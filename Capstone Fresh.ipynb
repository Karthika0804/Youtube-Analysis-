We shall use a de-normalized dataset taken from Kaggle for illustration purposes. We shall follow different normal forms to normalize the Kaggle dataset which should give a complete understanding of how to normalize any dataset.\\nFinally, in the third and last section, I shall explain the different anomalies that exist in a de-normalized dataset such as insertion, updation, and deletion anomalies.

This is a very frequently asked SQL Interview questions especially when a recruiter wants to test your knowledge on SQL joins, this is the kind of questions you can expect.\\n\\nIn this video, we shall look at 2 different datasets. Each dataset contains 2 tables which has duplicate data, null values etc. You are required to identify the no of records returned using INNER Join, LEFT Join, RIGHT Join, FULL JOIN, Natural  Join and Cross  Join. And you need to answer them without querying the tables. \\n\\nHence in order to answer such questions, you need to understand clearly how SQL internally performs different type of joins.\\n\\nDownload the dataset used in the video from my blog.

       "  'description': 'In this video, we will solve an SQL Query where we will need to transform data from rows to column.\\nWe can transform data from rows to column in SQL using PIVOT operator but not all RDBMS supports PIVOT. Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle supports PIVOT operator, whereas in PostgreSQL, we can transform rows to column using CROSSTAB function. Similarly in MySQL database, rows to column transformation can be done using the CASE statement.\\n\\nHence in this video, we shall first look at the SQL query problem statement. We understand the input data and also understand the expected output. After this we shall write SQL query to solve this problem using PIVOT in Microsoft SQL Server and in Oracle.\\nWe shall then solve the same problem in PostgreSQL database using CROSSTAB function. Finally we shall also solve this query in MySQL database using the CASE statement.\\n\\nAll the datasets, scripts and SQL queries used in this video can be downloaded from my blog and from my discord channel.

We cover everything you need to know about SQL VIEWS and how to effectively use SQL Views.\\n\\nThe video starts by explaining what a View is and how different it is from a table. We then look at how to create a View and also explain in detail the purpose of using a view in sql. We talk about the advantages of views in sql and why we use views in SQL.\\n\\nWe then see how to create a view using CREATE OR REPLACE command and how different it is from just the CREATE VIEW command. I mention in detail all the rules you need to know when using CREATE OR REPLACE command.\\nWe also see how to modify a View using the ALTER command. \\nI also mention some tips and tricks about Views that can be essential to clear interview questions related to Views.\\n\\nAt the end of the video we look at updatable views i.e. the views which can be updated or inserted or deleted. We look at the different rules we need to follow in order to create a view which can be updated.\\n\\nFinally we talk about the WITH CHECK OPTION clause when creating a view. We understand why we use WITH CHECK OPTION clause and how is it useful in certain cases.\\n\\nThe only VIEW concept not covered in this video is about the Materialized View. I will be making a separate video about Materialized View very soon.\\n\\nHopefully this video should give you complete understanding about VIEWS and how to effectively use VIEWS in SQL.\\n\\nIf you liked this video and would like to learn more about SQL then make sure to Subscribe to my channel.\\n\\nPractice SQL Queries here: https://stratascratch.com/?via=techTFQ\\n\\nMy recommended SQL Course: https://learnsql.com/?ref=thoufiqmohammed\\n\\n[All the scripts and SQL queries used in this video is shared in my Discord server.]\\nJoin my Discord Server: https://discord.gg/8aRSbygbdu\\n\\n\\nFTC disclaimer: This video was sponsored by Skillshare. \\n\\n\\n🔴 WATCH MORE VIDEOS HERE 👇\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Basic concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9HQQ_COgGb7kf_1H8UWUBxO\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Intermediate concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FD9XspliRM_HZM_jK7tkii\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Advance concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9GbmgiW4TWVnxhjMFOIf0Q7\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Basic SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9F66P3GFo5O6nJ4DfZNhVsp\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Intermediate SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9EIYmNXJ8ZtQ1bmLIpt0SpV\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Complex SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9Fahr7taauUx5RnTfuGyL--\\n\\n✅ Data Analytics Career guidance:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FDsr995DjwCy9XNaIukb8P\\n\\n✅ SQL Course, SQL Training Platform Recommendations:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9GqF1Q_zn8KnYvFgtEOh-2n\\n\\n✅ Python Tutorial:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FePZXIo4jpsupqp3X0w2SW\\n\\nTHANK YOU,\\nThoufiq',\n",

StrataScratch is an online platform where you can find hundreds of interview questions related to SQL and Python. You can solve these SQL Interview Questions on the StrataScratch platform itself without the need to install any database or any other software. \\n\\nThere are hundreds of different SQL Interview problem which have been asked by big tech companies. You would find SQL questions for beginner, for intermediate level and for expert level programmers. So no matter what your level of expertise is in SQL, you would find several different SQL questions to solve depending on your skill level.\\n\\nIn this video, I will solve 2 different SQL questions, \\nFirst we shall solve the “Users By Avg Session time” question. Now I will be providing 2 different solutions to this problem. One solution using subqueries and the second solution using JOINS. Hopefully this gives you an idea of how to solve a problem using different approaches.\\nSecondly, we shall solve the “Seat Availability” question. We shall solve this problem using self JOIN and UNION operator. \\n\\nI will explain in detail my thinking behind solving these problems and also the reasoning behind using certain logic.\\n\\nMy recommended SQL Course: https://learnsql.com/?ref=thoufiqmoha...\\n\\n[All the scripts and SQL queries used in this video is shared in my Discord server.

In this video we shall cover FULL OUTER Join, CROSS Join, NATURAL Join and SELF Join. In the first part of this video series, I had covered INNER Join, LEFT join and RIGHT Join.\\n\\nI start this video by discussing about FULL OUTER Join. But in order to understand FULL OUTER Join, we need to first look at the difference in output from INNER, LEFT and RIGHT JOIN. So we go through the difference in these 3 joins first and then I explain the concept of FULL OUTER Join.\\nWe then cover CROSS join and I explain a scenario where you may need to use CROSS join.\\nWe then talk about NATURAL join. I\\'ll tell you the difference between NATURAL join and INNER join and also tell you why you should not be using NATURAL Join.\\nFinally, we cover one of the most important JOINS in SQL which is the SELF JOIN. I explain SELF join by taking a real world example. \\nEvery concept is explained by writing SQL queries so hopefully this video along with the first part of this video, should help you to completely understand JOINS in SQL.\\n\\nJoins are the most fundamental concepts in SQL and having a clear understanding of Joins is very essential to write good SQL queries.\\n\\nTimeline:\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:54 FULL OUTER JOIN in SQL\\n10:20 CROSS JOIN in SQL\\n16:44 NATURAL JOIN in SQL\\n21:51 SELF JOIN in SQL\\n\\nWatch the first part of this SQL JOINS Tutorial Series:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OQJDd3QqQM&t=1720s \\n\\nMy recommended SQL Course: https://learnsql.com/?ref=thoufiqmohammed\\n\\nJoin my Discord Server: https://discord.gg/8aRSbygbdu\\n\\nJoin my FREE live SQL training session:\\nBatch 1 - Started on 03-Jan-2022 (08:00 pm Malaysian Time / 05:30 pm Indian Time)\\nDay: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday\\nRegistration Link: https://www.lighthall.co/class/305d73cb-2381-4499-9088-54e82a4de7b8/\\n\\nBatch 2 - Starts on 17-Jan-2022 (09:30 pm Malaysian Time / 07:00 pm Indian Time)\\nDay: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday\\nRegistration Link: https://www.lighthall.co/class/185a13de-31a5-475a-abc3-b64926c054dc/\\n\\nNote: Both batch 1 and batch 2 will cover the exact same topics.

We shall download Olympics dataset from Kaggle and then write SQL Queries to fetch different information from this Olympics data.\\n\\nUnderstanding the underlying data stored across different tables will make it much easier to write SQL queries. And that is why we will use real data (real dataset) to write SQL queries in this video.\\n\\nWe start this video by downloading the Olympics history dataset from kaggle website. We then load this dataset into a PostgreSQL database. Meaning we store this data into database tables. Once the data is stored in tables, we then write SQL queries to fetch different information about the history of Olympic games.\\n\\nI have come up with 20 different SQL queries which we can write on this Olympics dataset. I have posted all these queries in my blog. However, in this video, I will solve only 4 of the SQL queries which I feel are the most complex. If I tried to cover all the 20 SQL queries, then the video would have been many hours long.\\n\\nThe 20 SQL Queries should give you very good understanding of how to write different types of queries and how to think different when solving a SQL problem. \\n\\nLink to my blog: hhttps://techtfq.com/blog/practice-writing-sql-queries-using-real-dataset\\nLink to Kaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results\\n\\n\\nTimestamp:\\n00:00 Intro\\n02:41 Download dataset from Kaggle\\n04:22 Load Kaggle dataset to PostgreSQL database\\n12:25 Query 1 - Write SQL query to identify the sport which was played in all summer Olympic games.\\n21:21 Query 2 - Write SQL query to fetch the top 5 athletes who won the most Olympics gold medal.\\n26:12 Query 3 - Write SQL query to display the total gold, silver and bronze medal won by each country in Olympics.\\n40:17 Query 4 - Write SQL query to fetch the country which won the most gold, most silver and most bronze medal during each Olympic game.\\n\\n\\n🔴 WATCH MORE VIDEOS HERE 👇\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Basic concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9HQQ_COgGb7kf_1H8UWUBxO\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Intermediate concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FD9XspliRM_HZM_jK7tkii\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Advance concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9GbmgiW4TWVnxhjMFOIf0Q7\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Basic SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9F66P3GFo5O6nJ4DfZNhVsp\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Intermediate SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9EIYmNXJ8ZtQ1bmLIpt0SpV\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Complex SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9Fahr7taauUx5RnTfuGyL--\\n\\n✅ Data Analytics Career guidance:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FDsr995DjwCy9XNaIukb8P\\n\\n✅ SQL Course, SQL Training Platform Recommendations:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9GqF1Q_zn8KnYvFgtEOh-2n\\n\\n✅ Python Tutorial:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FePZXIo4jpsupqp3X0w2SW\\n\\nTHANK YOU,\\nThoufiq\",\n",

       "  'description': 'In this video, we build a Python Project to Scrape YouTube data using YouTube Data API. Using YouTube API, we extract the data and then load this data into a Python Pandas DataFrame and then analyze this data. Finally, we build simple visualization from this data using the Python Seaborn library.\\n\\nLink to create YouTube API Key: https://console.cloud.google.com/\\nLink to Google YouTube Data API documentation: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3\\nLink to my blog where you can download this project for free: https://techtfq.com/video/python-project-to-scrape-youtube-using-youtube-data-api\\n\\nTimestamp:\\n00:00 Intro\\n01:19 How to generate YouTube API Key\\n03:27 Google YouTube Data API Documentation\\n07:48 Pre Requisite for project (Creating virtual environment and install python packages)\\n09:45 Part 1 - Scrape Channel statistics from youtube. Analyze and Visualize YouTube channel\\n32:32 Part 2 - Scrape Video details for a youtube channel. Analyze and Visualize video details.\\n\\nWe start this project by first creating an YouTube API Key which will be our credential to access youtube data. I will should you in detail, how to create an API Key. \\nOnce the API Key is generated, we will then learn how to use this API key to access different youtube data. I.e. we will walk through the documentation given by google to use youtube API. We will look at the different sections in the documentation to access different data we need to build this project. We will also look at the sample python code given by google to call different resources and methods to fetch youtube data.\\n\\nFinally, we will get into writing the python code to build this project. I will be using Jupyter Notebook to write my python code. Since it is a new project, we will create a new virtual environment for this project. We will use anaconda for this. Once the virtual environment is set, we will then install all the required python packages. So we will install \"google-api-python-client\" (which is the google python package required to access youtube api data), we will also install pandas and seaborn. I will show you how to create a virtual environment and also how to install all these packages in detail.\\n\\nOnce our environment is set and required packages are installed, we will then start writing the code in Jupyter Notebook. I have divided this project into 2 parts.\\nIn the first part, we extract channel details from youtube. I.e. we extract details such as youtube channel name, total no of subscribers, total views and total number of videos posted by each channel. We gather these details for few Data Analyst/Data Scientist kind of channel and then compare these channel data with each other. We shall see who has the highest subscriber and who gets the most views and the amount of videos posted by these channels. We will be loading all of this data into a pandas dataframe and then analyze it. We will also generate some basic visualization using this data so we can easily compare these multiple channels.\\n\\nIn the second part of the video, we shall build a logic to extract video details from a particular channel. We shall extract details such as video title, total views each video has got, total number of likes, dislikes and comments each video has got. We shall extract these details for all of the videos posted by a particular channel. We will then analyze this data by loading it into a pandas dataframe. At the end we will create some simple visualization using Seaborn python library.\\n\\nHopefully, this can be a good starting project for anyone aspiring to become a Data Analyst. If you find this video useful then please make sure to like the video and subscribe to the channel.\\n\\n🔴 WATCH MORE VIDEOS HERE 👇\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Basic concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9HQQ_COgGb7kf_1H8UWUBxO\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Intermediate concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FD9XspliRM_HZM_jK7tkii\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Advance concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9GbmgiW4TWVnxhjMFOIf0Q7\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Basic SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9F66P3GFo5O6nJ4DfZNhVsp\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Intermediate SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9EIYmNXJ8ZtQ1bmLIpt0SpV\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Complex SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9Fahr7taauUx5RnTfuGyL--\\n\\n✅ Data Analytics Career guidance:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FDsr995DjwCy9XNaIukb8P\\n\\n✅ SQL Course, SQL Training Platform Recommendations:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9GqF1Q_zn8KnYvFgtEOh-2n\\n\\n✅ Python Tutorial:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FePZXIo4jpsupqp3X0w2SW\\n\\nTHANK YOU,\\nThoufiq',\n",

       "  'description': 'ANACONDA Tutorial for Python | How to Install Anaconda on Mac OS and How to use Anaconda for Python\\nIn this video, let us understand how to use ANACONDA for python. We shall see what is ANACONDA, how to use ANACONDA for python and why do we need to use ANACONDA for python. We shall also cover how to install anaconda on Mac OS. The installation would be similar for Windows and Linux systems as well.\\n\\nIf you are new to python, then you would probably have heard of anaconda but for a beginner it would be very confusing to know why do we need anaconda and how to use it and how is it beneficial to use anaconda over standalone python. So that is why in this video, I want to make it very clear on what is anaconda and why you should be using it.\\n\\nTimestamp\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:39 What is Anaconda for python and Why do we need to use Anaconda?\\n03:30 How to install anaconda? Getting started with Anaconda\\n08:17 How to use Visual Studio code IDE with anaconda\\n10:05 How to create virtual environment using anaconda\\n12:05 How to work with different anaconda virtual environments\\n15:23 What are anaconda channels and how to add channels to anaconda\\n\\nAnaconda is a python distribution, meaning when you install anaconda, it comes with python, a lot of python packages, tools and software which would be very essential especially if you are working in the field of data science. Anaconda also comes with conda, which is a package manager similar to pip. Conda can be used to install python packages and conda can also be used to create and manage virtual environments.\\nSo anaconda can be treated as a bundle package which not only includes python but everything else you would need to conveniently work with python especially in the field of data science.\\nSo we start this video by talking about what is anaconda and why we should be using it. I also mention a use case where using anaconda can be very beneficial.\\n\\nOnce we understand what is anaconda and why we should be using it, we then move into installing anaconda in our machine. Since I use Mac OS, the video shows how to install anaconda on Mac OS but the process would be same if you are on Windows or Linux system as well.\\n\\nOnce anaconda is installed, we then see how to use conda base environment. We see how to use anaconda with Visual Studio Code IDE which is also referred to as VS Code. We look at the different conda commands.\\nWe then see how to create different virtual environments using conda command and then create specific python packages in each of our virtual environments. We then see how to work with different anaconda virtual environments in VS code.\\n\\nFinally, we talk about channels in anaconda. We see what is a channel and how to add a new channel to the existing list of channels in anaconda. \\n\\nCHEAT CODE of all the ANACONDA commands used in this video:\\nconda (List down all conda commands)\\nconda list (List of all the python packages in the activated environment)\\nconda env list (List of all environments)\\nconda activate env-name (Activate environment \"env-name\")\\nconda deactivate (Deactivate from current conda environment)\\nconda create —name env-name python=3.7 (Create a virtual environment)\\nconda env remove —name DS-env (Remove a virtual environment)\\nconda install scikit-learn (Install a python package by name \"scikit-learn\")\\npython3 —version (Get python version in current environment)\\nwhich python3 (Get the location where python is installed)\\nconda config —show channels (List of all channels in anaconda)\\nconda config —get channels (List of all channels along with its priority)\\nconda config —add channels conda-forge (Add a new channel)\\nconda config —remove channels conda-forge (Remove a channel)\\n\\n🔴 WATCH MORE VIDEOS HERE 👇\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Basic concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9HQQ_COgGb7kf_1H8UWUBxO\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Intermediate concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FD9XspliRM_HZM_jK7tkii\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Advance concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9GbmgiW4TWVnxhjMFOIf0Q7\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Basic SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9F66P3GFo5O6nJ4DfZNhVsp\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Intermediate SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9EIYmNXJ8ZtQ1bmLIpt0SpV\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Complex SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9Fahr7taauUx5RnTfuGyL--\\n\\n✅ Data Analytics Career guidance:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FDsr995DjwCy9XNaIukb8P\\n\\n✅ SQL Course, SQL Training Platform Recommendations:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9GqF1Q_zn8KnYvFgtEOh-2n\\n\\n✅ Python Tutorial:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FePZXIo4jpsupqp3X0w2SW\\n\\n✅ Git and GitHub Tutorial:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9EI1MPlqqDpe3bgr8RJZE0b\\n\\n✅ Data Analytics Projects:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9HwT_uStsDdJbuBOt_XD0ch\\n\\nTHANK YOU,\\nThoufiq',\n",

We shall write a python program which will use the Psycopg2 module to connect to the PostgreSQL database and then perform some database or SQL transactions such as creating a table and then insert data to the table, updating a table data and delete records from the table using python code. We shall also see how to fetch table data from postgres database to python program.\\n\\nAt the end of the video, I will also cover how to use Context Manager to perform all of the above SQL operations. That is, we will use the WITH clause to connect to the database and also use the WITH clause to open the cursor. I will also mention what are the advantages of using WITH clause and why it is recommended to always use context manager or WITH clause when working with database in python.\\n\\nDownload the Python script used in this video from my blog. Link below:\\nhttps://techtfq.com/video/connect-to-postgresql-from-python-using-sql-in-python\\n\\nTimeline:\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:42 Prerequisites for connecting to PostgreSQL from Python\\n02:18 Connecting to PostgreSQL from Python\\n05:33 Opening a cursor to perform database operations\\n07:52 CREATE Table in PostgreSQL database from Python program\\n10:37 INSERT single record to a table in PostgreSQL from Python program\\n12:23 INSERT multiple records to PostgreSQL table from Python program\\n14:30 FETCH data from PostgreSQL Table and display in Python program\\n17:23 UPDATE Table data in PostgreSQL database from Python program\\n18:50 DELETE Table record in PostgreSQL database from Python program\\n20:14 Using Context Manager to connect to PostgreSQL database from Python\\n\\nWe shall be using psycopg2 module to connect to PostgreSQL database from python, which is considered to be one of the best libraries to connect to postgres from python.\\n\\nWe shall start the video by covering the couple of pre-requisites which is to first install the psycopg2 module and then finding the credentials or information required to connect to the postgres database. \\n\\nAfter this we shall write the python program which will initially connect to the PostgreSQL database and then open a cursor which will be then used to perform the database operations like CREATE TABLE, INSERT INTO Table, UPDATE Table data, DELETE table record and also how to fetch or retrieve table records or table data from the database to Python program.\\n\\nFinally, we shall end the video by talking about context manager way of connecting to the database and also how to use context manager to open a cursor. Using context manager is simply using the WITH clause while connecting to the database and then also using the WITH clause while opening the cursor.\\nI will also mention the advantages of using a context manager over the traditional method or connecting to data and opening the cursor. And also mention why is it recommended to always use context manager when connecting to database in python.\\n\\nHopefully this video helped and gave you some useful information of using SQL within python program.

We shall go through five different complex SQL queries and try to solve it. The intention is to practice complex SQL queries.  The idea is to not just write SQL Queries but also to explain you the thinking behind how to choose a particular approach to solve a SQL query and how to choose different SQL functions or concepts to solve a problem.\\n\\nLink to my blog where I have posted all of these SQL Queries:\\nhttps://techtfq.com/blog/learn-how-to-write-sql-queries-practice-complex-sql-queries\\n\\nIn this blog, you will find 9 SQL queries along with all the scripts to create the table, load data into these tables and also the solved SQL Queries. Out of these 9 SQL Queries, In this video, I have only solved 5 of them in order to reduce the video length.\\n\\nTimeline:\\n00:00 Intro\\n01:36 Intro about the blog\\n03:25 SQL Query to fetch duplicate records from a table using window function\\n09:27 SQL Query to fetch doctors working in same hospital using self join\\n15:55 SQL Query to fetch users who logged in consecutively 3 or more times\\n25:10 SQL Query to fetch days when the temperature was very cold for consecutively 3 or more days\\n36:13 SQL Query to fetch top 2 accounts with maximum patients per month\\n\\nLearning SQL Concepts and practically writing SQL queries are two different things. You may be familiar with the concept such as window function but until and unless you apply these concepts to write SQL queries, you will never truly understand SQL.\\n\\nMay of the queries I am going to solve in this video, I will be using window function such as LEAD, LAG, RANK, ROW_NUMBER etc. However, some of the queries are solved using self join, sub queries or inner joins.\\n\\nThe idea behind making this video, is to explain the thinking behind solving an SQL question. How to read the question and understand the problem statement and then analyze the existing data so that we can come up with an approach to write a query which can return the required result. These steps are very important in order for us to determine the different SQL concepts or functions to be used to solve the problem.\\n\\nPlease comment below your feedback if you liked this kind of video or if you have any doubts on any other queries mentioned in the blog.\\n\\n🔴 WATCH MORE VIDEOS HERE 👇\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Basic concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9HQQ_COgGb7kf_1H8UWUBxO\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Intermediate concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FD9XspliRM_HZM_jK7tkii\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Advance concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9GbmgiW4TWVnxhjMFOIf0Q7\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Basic SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9F66P3GFo5O6nJ4DfZNhVsp\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Intermediate SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9EIYmNXJ8ZtQ1bmLIpt0SpV\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Complex SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9Fahr7taauUx5RnTfuGyL--\\n\\n✅ Data Analytics Career guidance:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FDsr995DjwCy9XNaIukb8P\\n\\n✅ SQL Course, SQL Training Platform Recommendations:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9GqF1Q_zn8KnYvFgtEOh-2n\\n\\n✅ Python Tutorial:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FePZXIo4jpsupqp3X0w2SW\\n\\n✅ Git and GitHub Tutorial:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9EI1MPlqqDpe3bgr8RJZE0b\\n\\n✅ Data Analytics Projects:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9HwT_uStsDdJbuBOt_XD0ch\\n\\nTHANK YOU,\\nThoufiq',\n",

       "  'description': 'SQL Window Function. How to write SQL Query using Frame Clause, CUME_DIST. SQL Queries Tutorial.\\n\\nThis video is about Window Functions in SQL which is also referred to as Analytic Function in some of the RDBMS. SQL Window Functions covered in this video are FIRST_VALUE, LAST_VALUE, NTH_VALUE, NTILE, CUME_DIST and PERCENT_RANK. Also we cover how to use FRAME Clause while writing SQL Queries using window function. We also look at alternate way of writing SQL Query using window function. \\n\\nWe discuss in detail about the Frame clause and how RANGE is different from ROWS and how to use Unbounded Preceding and Unbounded Following while using certain window functions.\\n\\nThis is the second video where we talk about window functions in SQL. I have made another video covering other window functions such as RANK, DENSE RANK, LEAD, LAG and ROW NUMBER. Link to the previous video is mentioned below:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww71knvhQ-s&t=119s\\n\\nThis video is focused on teaching how to write SQL Queries using different window functions or analytic functions. We go through the syntax of using first value, last value, frame clause, nth value. ntile, cume dist and percent rank as window function in SQL query.\\n\\nWe look at how to use WINDOW clause while writing SQL query using window functions. We talk about the OVER clause and how partition by clause can impact the result set.\\n\\nOver clause is explained in detail in this video. Over clause is used in SQL when we need to use window function. Inside Over clause, we also use Partition By clause and also Order by clause.\\nPartition By clause is used to specify the column based on which different windows needs to be created.\\n\\nThe window function you learn in this video is applicable to any RDBMS since these functions are commonly used across most of the popular RDBMS such as Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server etc.\\n\\n\\n/**** Download all the SQL Queries, Table Structure and Table data used in this video ***/\\nLink:  https://techtfq.com/video/sql-window-function-sql-queries-tutorial-part-2\\nOn this page, Click on the button which says \"Download SQL Script\" to download the .sql file (.sql file can be opened in any text editor)\\n\\nTimestamp:\\n00:00 Intro\\n02:12 FIRST_VALUE\\n07:25 LAST_VALUE\\n10:25 Frame Clause\\n22:26 Alternate way of writing SQL Query using window function using Window clause\\n26:41 NTH_VALUE\\n31:47 NTILE\\n38:02 CUME_DIST\\n47:35 PERCENT_RANK\\n\\nI hope this video was helpful and gives you a good understanding of how to write SQL Queries using window functions or analytic functions.

       "  'description': 'Git Tutorial for Complete Beginners | Learn Git in 35 minutes\\nIn this video, we shall cover everything you need to know to start working with Git. Git is a version control system which can be used to track any changes in a repository. \\nWe shall first understand what is Git and why do we need to use it. We shall then see how to install Git and configure Git. We will also look at the Git Workflow.\\nIn this video, I am going to build a simple digital clock using python. But I will build this project step by step so you can see how I add and commit different changes to git repository. \\n\\nTimeline:\\n00:00 Intro\\n01:10 What is Git\\n04:07 How to Install Git\\n05:52 How to Configure Git\\n07:39 How to create a Git Repository\\n10:07 What is Git Branch\\n11:41 Understanding Git Workflow\\n12:41 Git add (Adding changes to Git Staging area)\\n15:10 Git commit (Commit change to Git Repository)\\n18:29 Git log (Viewing the commit history)\\n23:16 Creating a Git Branch\\n26:52 Merge Branch\\n29:54 How to use Git Reset\\n31:08 How to use Git Checkout\\n32:21 Git Detached HEAD state\\n35:09 Finally comparing changes in multiple git branch \\n\\nWe shall also see the three layers of git repository i.e. the working directory, staging area and git repository.\\n\\nI am going explain in detail how to add files to staging area and then remove files form staging area if required. We shall see how to commit changes. We shall also discuss about the significance of git staging area and why we need it.\\n\\nFinally, we shall see what is a branch and how to create a branch and how to switch between different git branches. I will explain the significance of having multiple branch in your git repository and how we can merge changes from one branch to another.\\n\\nMerging branch is an important feature of Git so we shall explain git merge by creating a real digital clock project.\\n\\nThis video also covers git reset and git checkout. We use git reset and checkout to point HEAD to a different commit or different version of the repository. We shall see the difference between reset and checkout commands.\\n\\nHopefully this video should give you a complete idea about git and how to start working with git.\\n\\n\\n🔴 WATCH MORE VIDEOS HERE 👇\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Basic concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9HQQ_COgGb7kf_1H8UWUBxO\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Intermediate concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FD9XspliRM_HZM_jK7tkii\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Advance concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9GbmgiW4TWVnxhjMFOIf0Q7\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Basic SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9F66P3GFo5O6nJ4DfZNhVsp\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Intermediate SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9EIYmNXJ8ZtQ1bmLIpt0SpV\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Complex SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9Fahr7taauUx5RnTfuGyL--\\n\\n✅ Data Analytics Career guidance:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FDsr995DjwCy9XNaIukb8P\\n\\n✅ SQL Course, SQL Training Platform Recommendations:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9GqF1Q_zn8KnYvFgtEOh-2n\\n\\n✅ Python Tutorial:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FePZXIo4jpsupqp3X0w2SW\\n\\n✅ Git and GitHub Tutorial:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9EI1MPlqqDpe3bgr8RJZE0b\\n\\n✅ Data Analytics Projects:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9HwT_uStsDdJbuBOt_XD0ch\\n\\nTHANK YOU,\\nThoufiq',\n",

       "  'title': 'Web Scraping in Python using Beautiful Soup | Writing a Python program to Scrape IMDB website',\n",
       "  'description': 'Web Scraping in Python using Beautiful Soup module. In this video I will explain how to perform web scraping in Python using Beautiful Soup and Requests module. I will write a python program to scrape the IMDB website and then load the desired data into an excel file. I will write this program from scratch so you can follow along.\\n\\nWeb Scraping is the process of programmatically extracting some data from a website. In Python, we can easy write program to scrape website by using the Beautiful Soup and Requests module. Requests module can be used to access the desired website and Beautiful Soup module can be used to parse the HTML source code of the website. Beautiful soup makes it very easy to parse HTML content and then provides multiple methods which can be used to extract the data from any HTML tags. All the website are written in HTML language hence in order to perform web scrapping, our program needs to read the HTML content. This is were Beautiful Soup comes into picture to make it very easy to access the contents of HTML using very simple methods.\\n\\nYou don’t need to be an expert in HTML to learn python web scrapping. You just need to know the most basic HTML which is to know what is a tag and how to identify the attributes associated with a tag. \\n\\nIn this video, in order to explain the concept of web scraping using BeautifulSoup in Python, we will be writing a python program which will access the IMDB website and then fetch the top rated movies present in the IMDB website and then load this data into an excel file.\\nIMDB website contains movie ratings but in this program we are only interested in scraping the top rated movies of all time only.\\n\\nIn order to load data into an excel file, I will be using openpyxl module. Using openpyxl, it is very easy to create a new excel file and then rename the sheet name and then load data into the excel file. I won’t be explaining openpyxl in detail but will just cover enough to know how to create an excel file and then load data into an excel file.\\n\\nWe will be installing Requests module and Beautiful Soup module using the pip installer. I am using mac so the command in mac to be run from terminal is “pip3 install module_name”. If you are using windows then you need to run the pip install command from command prompt using the command as “pip install module_name”.\\n\\n🔴 WATCH MORE VIDEOS HERE 👇\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Basic concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9HQQ_COgGb7kf_1H8UWUBxO\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Intermediate concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FD9XspliRM_HZM_jK7tkii\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Advance concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9GbmgiW4TWVnxhjMFOIf0Q7\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Basic SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9F66P3GFo5O6nJ4DfZNhVsp\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Intermediate SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9EIYmNXJ8ZtQ1bmLIpt0SpV\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Complex SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9Fahr7taauUx5RnTfuGyL--\\n\\n✅ Data Analytics Career guidance:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FDsr995DjwCy9XNaIukb8P\\n\\n✅ SQL Course, SQL Training Platform Recommendations:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9GqF1Q_zn8KnYvFgtEOh-2n\\n\\n✅ Python Tutorial:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FePZXIo4jpsupqp3X0w2SW\\n\\n✅ Git and GitHub Tutorial:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9EI1MPlqqDpe3bgr8RJZE0b\\n\\n✅ Data Analytics Projects:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9HwT_uStsDdJbuBOt_XD0ch\\n\\nTHANK YOU,\\nThoufiq',\n",

       "  'description': 'If you have questions like How to Practice SQL and Python or How to Practice Programming or How to use LeetCode then this video is fro you. In this video, we look at how to Practice SQL queries and python programming using LeetCode.  \\nIf you are new to programming or if you are learning a new programming language, then one of the challenges you may be facing is “How to practice what you learn?”.\\nIn this video, we look at LeetCode which is a platform used to solve programming problems using any programming languages like Java, Python, JavaScript, Ruby, PhP, etc. There are also problems which can be solved in SQL and we can use any RDBMS to solve it such as Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL etc.\\n\\nThe best way to practice programming is by working on projects but then if you are a beginner then identifying what projects to work on and how to get started working on a project can be a daunting task. An alternative approach is to practice programming using platforms such as LeetCode. \\n\\nLeetCode is a website where you can find hundreds of programming problems which can be solved using any programming language of your choice. The problems are very good and can be the problems asked in a programming interview.

       "  'description': 'Logging Tutorial in Python | DON’T use Print for logging | How to Log messages in Python\\nIn this video, we learn how to use logging in python. Python logging module can be used to log messages. We show why Print statement should not be used in Python for logging messages. And the advantages of using logging module over print statement in python.\\n\\nThis logging tutorial video also covers the different levels of logging in python. We look at DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL levels of logging in python. We explain these logging levels by writing programs and showcasing the difference in logging by setting different logging levels.\\n\\nIf you are new to programming, then you might consider using print statement for logging messages in Python and you may wonder why use python logging module when print can do the same things but, in this video, I give you 2 use cases of the advantages of using logging module over print in python for the purpose of logging messages.\\n\\nIn the beginning of this python tutorial video, we discuss how to use logging module to log messages to your console and then we also see how to log messages to a file. \\nWe also cover how to disable logging in python. \\nWe start by using the root logger which is the default logger when we use the basic configuration of logging in python. At the end of the video, we also show to create your own logger and how to create separate logger for each of your program.\\n\\nWe discuss why it is not recommended to use root logger and the problems of using root logger. We look at the syntax to create a unique logger for each of our program.\\n\\nPython Website to get the different logging format:\\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logrecord-attributes\\n\\nI hope this video was helpful and gives you a good understanding of how to log messages in python using logging module.

       "  'description': 'This is a tutorial video on how to read and write files in Python. This video covers all the basic concepts required to get started with file handling in Python. File objects in Python can be used to read the contents of a file and also file objects can be used to write or append data into a file. \\n\\nIn this video, we cover all the basic concepts required to get started with handing files in Python. We first look at how to read a file which is stored in our operating system. And then cover the concepts of how to write data into a file and also how to append data into a file. \\nWe check out the different between using write and append in Python.\\n\\nTo open the file, we use context manager as well as the traditional method to open a file. We talk about the advantages of using context manager while opening a file in python and also explain why it is recommended in python to always use context manager when dealing with files.\\n\\nTimestamps:\\n00:00 How to Read and Write Files in Python\\n00:39 How to Read a file in Python\\n02:55 How to use Context Manager to open a file in Python\\n07:16 How to Write a file in Python\\n09:09 How to Append a file in Python\\n10:20 Program to read a file and append data to another file\\n13:17 How to access files in different path in Python\\n\\nIn this video, we also talk about to how to read a file which is present in different paths or directories. By providing absolute path or relative path to the file we can tell python to look for the desired file in that specific location. However, we can also change the current working directory to point at the path where our desired file is placed.\\nIf path is not mentioned, then Python always looks for the file in the current working directory. However, we can change the current working directory so as to point it to the location where our desired file is placed.\\nAlternatively, we can also provide the directory path of the file which we are trying to read. We can specify a path in two ways, one is by specifying the absolute path and second is by specifying the relative path.\\nIn this video, we talk about relative and absolute path and also show how you can extract the current working directory and also how you can change the current working directory.\\n\\nHope you learnt something from this video. If yes, then please make sure to like and share the video with friends and colleagues who may be interested in learning about files in python.\\nAlso, please do not hesitate to leave a comment if you have any questions related this topic.

       "  'description': 'Regular Expressions in Python. Regular Expressions Python Tutorial.\\nThis video is a complete tutorial on Regular Expressions in Python. This is a full course on how to use Regular Expressions in python. Regular Expression is also referred to as REGEX. Using Regular Expression, we can search for a pattern of string in the given text.\\n\\nRegular Expressions are a very powerful tool used to perform complex searches on a text. By specifying a pattern for the string, we need to search for, Regular Expressions can extract a string even if it is present in different format until and unless this string follows the same pattern as mentioned in the defined Regular Expressions pattern.\\n\\nIn this video, we go through the different steps to be followed to use Regular Expressions in python. We also explain the different character class, special characters and also all the Regular Expressions symbols or notations which can be used to define or create a pattern in Regular Expressions in python. We also write multiple python programs to create different patterns to match an email id, phone no and date values. Finally, we also cover the sub method in Regular Expression which can replace or substitute the matched string with a replacement string.\\n \\nThere are only 4 steps to be followed in order to use Regular Expressions in python:\\n    1. Import re module which is the Regular Expressions module in python. All the functions and features required to perform regular expression search in python can be accessed by importing the re module.\\n    2. Next steps is to create the Regular Expressions Pattern. Pattern is basically the format or structure of the string that we are trying to search. In Regular Expressions, we have several different character classes, symbols and special characters which will help us to identify every kind of characters or symbols hence making it possible to define a pattern to search of any type of string.\\n    3. Once the pattern is defined, next step is to search for this pattern in the given text or data.\\n    4. Finally, we extract all the matched string.\\n\\nI hope this video was helpful and gives you a good understanding of regular expressions in python.

       "  'description': 'What is Data Science (for beginners) | Data Science for Beginners | Data Science Life Cycle\\nIf you ever wondered, What is DATA SCIENCE, then in under 5 minutes, this video will explain the basics of data science and its life cycle.\\n\\nIn this video, you will learn what is data science (Explained for beginners) and the life cycle of a data science project. We explain in the simplest of terms what does data science mean? \\n\\nThere are several definitions for data science on the internet but in this video, we look at the core of data science and try to understand the most basic reason why data science is so widely used. Data Science can be a tricky topic if you are new to the world of data, so we explain data science for beginners in this video.\\n\\nWe look at the different problems data science can solve and how data science helps to solve these problems. Rather than giving in depth knowledge of data science, we give an overview of what data science is and who uses data science and why is data science used and what makes data science such a popular field of choice today. We go through few use cases of data science and how we can use data science methods to solve various types of problems. \\n\\nUnderstanding data science without being aware of its life cycle would be an incomplete understanding hence we go through the different stages involved in the life cycle of a data science project. Under each stage of data science life cycle, we explain why it is used and how does it help to solve the problem.\\n\\nLife Cycle of a Data Science project generally involves the below 6 stages:\\n1) Understanding the Requirement / Problem\\n2) Data Extraction and Data Cleansing\\n3) Exploratory Data Analysis\\n4) Data Visualization\\n5) Predictive Analytics\\n6) Prescriptive Analytics\\n\\nWe also mention the tools used during different stages of a Data Science project such as Python, SQL, Machine Learning Models, Hadoop, Spark, Spreadsheets etc.\\nWe also talk about the role played by a Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Business Analyst, Data Engineer and Software Engineers during different stages of the data science project.\\n\\nI hope this video was helpful and gives you an overview of Data Science. If you liked what you saw, then please make sure to like, subscribe and comment any feedback you may have. \\nAlso please do not hesitate to share the video with your friends and colleagues who may be interested in learning data science.\\n\\n🔴 WATCH MORE VIDEOS HERE 👇\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Basic concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9HQQ_COgGb7kf_1H8UWUBxO\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Intermediate concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FD9XspliRM_HZM_jK7tkii\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Advance concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9GbmgiW4TWVnxhjMFOIf0Q7\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Basic SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9F66P3GFo5O6nJ4DfZNhVsp\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Intermediate SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9EIYmNXJ8ZtQ1bmLIpt0SpV\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Complex SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9Fahr7taauUx5RnTfuGyL--\\n\\n✅ Data Analytics Career guidance:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FDsr995DjwCy9XNaIukb8P\\n\\n✅ SQL Course, SQL Training Platform Recommendations:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9GqF1Q_zn8KnYvFgtEOh-2n\\n\\n✅ Python Tutorial:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FePZXIo4jpsupqp3X0w2SW\\n\\n✅ Git and GitHub Tutorial:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9EI1MPlqqDpe3bgr8RJZE0b\\n\\n✅ Data Analytics Projects:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9HwT_uStsDdJbuBOt_XD0ch\\n\\nTHANK YOU,\\nThoufiq',\n",

       "  'description': 'Exception Handling in Python can be done using try except in python. Handling exceptions is one of the most important aspects of a good python program hence in python we can handle exceptions by placing the block of code which we assume to be causing error inside a try and except block. \\nAny error caused by the block of code within the try except clause won’t be returned to the user but will be handled by the except block. \\n\\nIn Python, we can also raise user defined exceptions using the raise Exception clause. Raise exception can be used anywhere in the code to cause an error based on certain conditions. \\nWe can raise and exception within the try except block so the user defined error can be caught by the try except block. \\n\\nWithin try except exception handling in python, we can also use ELSE and FINALLY clause. Block of code within else will be executed when the code within try does not throw an error. If the block of code within try causes an exception, then the except block will be called and the block of code within except will be executed. \\nBlock of code within finally, will be executed every time. Meaning whether there is an exception or not, if you have mentioned finally in your try exception block then the block of code within finally will always be executed.\\n\\nThis video is aimed at complete beginners who are just getting started with programming or with python programming. The concepts are explaining in the most basic manner so anyone can understand it. \\n\\nThe purpose of this Python tutorial series for beginners is to explain python programming in the most simplest manner by providing simple examples and working out interesting and meaningful python programs which should be a better way to learn programming especially for the beginners. \\n\\nAll the programs and content of this video will be posted in my website https://techtfq.com/ \\n\\nSo please make sure to check that out as well.\\n\\nOther video’s in this tutorial series:\\n\\nLocal and Global Scope in Python | Local and Global Variables | Python Tutorial for Beginners #7\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bwpXLHzZRo\\n\\nWhat is a FUNCTION in Python | Python Functions | Python Tutorial for Beginners #6\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzOnFDmoJ9w&t=16s\\n\\nImport modules in Python | Import module from different directory | Python Tutorial for Beginners #5\\nhttps://youtu.be/HNChkuE6HyA\\n\\nWHILE loop and FOR loop in Python | LOOP statements in Python | Python Tutorial for Beginners #4\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gFqUWO-AWM&t=107s\\n\\nIF ELSE ELIF statement in Python | IF ELSE Statement in Python | Python Tutorial for Beginners #3\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvdSKgQcyuc&t=28s\\n\\nWhat is a VARIABLE in Python | Python Variables | Python Tutorial for Beginners #2\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBb_duZIusU&t=21s\\n\\nWhat are DATA TYPE, OPERATORS and EXPRESSION in Python | Python Tutorial for Absolute Beginners #1\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRGkYivK2xI&t=68s\\n\\n\\nPlease like, subscribe and leave a comment if you found the video to be useful.

       "  'description': 'Local and Global Scope in Python determine Local and Global Variables in Python. In this video, we discuss local and global scope in a python program and write multiple python program to understand the different scope in python program. We also check out the five things you need to remember when working with local and global variables in python.\\n\\nThis is the seventh video in the series of python tutorial for beginners. This video is focused on understanding the different scope in a python program. We see how to identify a local scope and a global scope and then see how to create a local and global variable in python.\\n\\nPython supports both local and global variables but there are certain rules to follow when working with local and global variables. Important things to note are:\\n1. Local variables cannot be accessed in global scope.\\n2. Local variables cannot be accessed from other local scope.\\n3. Global variables can be accessed by any local scope.\\n4. Local and Global variables can share the same name.\\n5. Global variables can be modified inside a local scope using the “global” keyword.\\n\\nThis video is aimed at complete beginners who are just getting started with programming or with python programming. The concepts are explaining in the most basic manner so anyone can understand it. \\n\\nThe purpose of this Python tutorial series for beginners is to explain python programming in the most simplest manner by providing simple examples and working out interesting and meaningful python programs which should be a better way to learn programming especially for the beginners. \\n\\nAll the programs and content of this video will be posted in my website https://techtfq.com/ \\n\\nSo please make sure to check that out as well.\\n\\nOther video’s in this tutorial series:\\n\\nWhat is a FUNCTION in Python | Python Functions | Python Tutorial for Beginners #6\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzOnFDmoJ9w&t=16s\\n\\nImport modules in Python | Import module from different directory | Python Tutorial for Beginners #5\\nhttps://youtu.be/HNChkuE6HyA\\n\\nWHILE loop and FOR loop in Python | LOOP statements in Python | Python Tutorial for Beginners #4\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gFqUWO-AWM&t=107s\\n\\nIF ELSE ELIF statement in Python | IF ELSE Statement in Python | Python Tutorial for Beginners #3\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvdSKgQcyuc&t=28s\\n\\nWhat is a VARIABLE in Python | Python Variables | Python Tutorial for Beginners #2\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBb_duZIusU&t=21s\\n\\nWhat are DATA TYPE, OPERATORS and EXPRESSION in Python | Python Tutorial for Absolute Beginners #1\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRGkYivK2xI&t=68s\\n\\nPlease like, subscribe and leave a comment if you found the video to be useful.

This is the sixth video in the series of Python Tutorial for Beginners. How to write a function in python program and different functionalities associated with python functions are covered in this video.\\n\\nWe start by explaining the definition of function and show a sample python code to create a function. How to create a function with a parameter and without a parameter is shown with sample python program. We look at what a parameter is and how to pass an argument during function call. We discuss the difference between an argument and a parameter in python functions.\\n\\nWe also cover return statements in python function. We see what happens when we write a function without a return statement. We also cover how to pass a return value in function. \\n\\nFinally, we go through each of these concepts in python functions by writing a sample python program to count the number of vowel characters in a given name. In this sample program we create a function named count vowels using the DEF keyword and then pass a parameter to it. From the python program we call this count vowels function and pass an argument which will be used by our function to find the number of vowel characters in it.\\n\\nThis video is aimed at beginners who would like to understand what a function is in python and how to create a function in python and how to use a parameter and use a return statement in python functions. \\n\\nThe purpose of this Python tutorial series for beginners is to explain python programming in the most simplest manner by providing simple examples and working out interesting and meaningful python programs which should be a better way to learn programming especially for the beginners. \\n\\nAll the programs and content of this video will be posted in my website https://techtfq.com/ \\n\\nSo please make sure to check that out as well.\\n\\nOther video’s in this tutorial series:\\n\\nImport modules in Python | Import module from different directory | Python Tutorial for Beginners #5\\nhttps://youtu.be/HNChkuE6HyA\\n\\nWHILE loop and FOR loop in Python | LOOP statements in Python | Python Tutorial for Beginners #4\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gFqUWO-AWM&t=107s\\n\\nIF ELSE ELIF statement in Python | IF ELSE Statement in Python | Python Tutorial for Beginners #3\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvdSKgQcyuc&t=28s\\n\\nWhat is a VARIABLE in Python | Python Variables | Python Tutorial for Beginners #2\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBb_duZIusU&t=21s\\n\\nWhat are DATA TYPE, OPERATORS and EXPRESSION in Python | Python Tutorial for Absolute Beginners #1\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRGkYivK2xI&t=68s\\n\\nPlease like, subscribe and leave a comment if you found the video to be useful.

This is the third video in the series of Python Tutorial for Beginners. But before writing IF statement, we learn what is a Boolean data type, what are comparison operators and what are boolean operators or Logical operators. These concepts are required to be understood before starting with IF ELSE statement.\\n\\n\\nIF statement is part of the Flow Control statements in python which also includes loop statements such as while loop and for loop. \\nFlow control statement or control flow statement in python decides which instruction to execute based on which condition hence it’s a very essential part of python programming.\\n\\nThe condition in IF statement either needs to have an expression which always evaluate to a boolean value or the condition in IF statement needs to have a boolean value. \\nUnderstanding of Python Boolean is essential to understand IF statement.

       "  'description': 'How to install Python on Mac OS and How to write and execute or run your first Python program on Mac OS will be covered in this video.\\nWe start by installing Python 3 and then go through 3 ways to write and execute Python program on Mac.\\n3 ways to write and execute Python program covered in this video are:\\n    1. Using IDLE, which is an IDE that comes along with Python installation.\\n    2. Using any text editor (in my case I use Atom) to write python program and then execute the program using Terminal window.\\n    3. By using Visual Studio Code (or simple VS Code), which is considered as one of the best IDE for Python.\\n\\nInstalling Python 3 on Mac can be confusing due to the existence of Python 2 which is preinstalled on all Mac OS. However, Python 2 and Python 3 can co-exist on the same machine hence we do not need to uninstall Python 2 before installing Python 3.\\n\\nTo Install Python 3, there are no prerequisites, and the installation is pretty straight forward.\\nTo run your Python code may be confusing for beginners hence in this video we cover 3 different ways or 3 different editors which can be used to get started with writing and running python code.\\n\\nWhen executing python code through IDLE, it’s essential to execute the RUN command from the text editor and then view the output in IDLE interpreter.\\nWhereas text editor does not have the functionality to run program by itself hence we use Terminal window to run the program.\\nVisual Studio Code (or simple VS Code) along with PyCharm, Jupiter Notebook and few others are considered as one of the best IDE for Python hence in this video we show how VS Code can be used to write and Run Python program.\\n\\nThe video is aimed at helping beginners to get started with installation of Python programming language on Mac and by showing multiple ways to start writing and executing Python code. \\n\\nReference Links:\\nPython Download:\\nhttps://www.python.org/downloads/\\n\\nVisual Studio Code Download:\\nhttps://code.visualstudio.com/download\\n\\nAtom Download:\\nhttps://atom.io/\\n\\n\\nPlease like, subscribe and click on the notification bell to be notified of my latest video’s.\\n\\n🔴 WATCH MORE VIDEOS HERE 👇\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Basic concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9HQQ_COgGb7kf_1H8UWUBxO\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Intermediate concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FD9XspliRM_HZM_jK7tkii\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Advance concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9GbmgiW4TWVnxhjMFOIf0Q7\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Basic SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9F66P3GFo5O6nJ4DfZNhVsp\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Intermediate SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9EIYmNXJ8ZtQ1bmLIpt0SpV\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Complex SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9Fahr7taauUx5RnTfuGyL--\\n\\n✅ Data Analytics Career guidance:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FDsr995DjwCy9XNaIukb8P\\n\\n✅ SQL Course, SQL Training Platform Recommendations:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9GqF1Q_zn8KnYvFgtEOh-2n\\n\\n✅ Python Tutorial:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FePZXIo4jpsupqp3X0w2SW\\n\\n✅ Git and GitHub Tutorial:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9EI1MPlqqDpe3bgr8RJZE0b\\n\\n✅ Data Analytics Projects:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9HwT_uStsDdJbuBOt_XD0ch\\n\\nTHANK YOU,\\nThoufiq',\n",

I like how when you ran the second example in multiple DBMSs, you went in an order that made you do an ever-increasing number of changes. :) I'll add another layer: if you were using Db2, you would have to 1. remove the RECURSIVE keywork, 2. use UNION ALL instead of UNION (I generally discourage using UNION by itself anyway), 3. specify column aliases as part of your CTE syntax (so far all the same changes you need for Oracle)...AND you also can't do an INNER JOIN in your recursive CTE! Not a problem for Example 1 (output integers 1 through 10), but for Example 2 it means you would have to go back in time to a time before INNER JOIN was invented (pre-1992!) and change your (INNER) JOIN to a Cartesian join (using the old-school comma-separated list of tablenames...not even the CROSS JOIN syntax!) followed by the appropriate WHERE clause to ensure you only get back the same rows that you would have with an INNER JOIN.

       "   'A database is a structured collection of data that is organized, stored, and managed in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, updating, and manipulation of the data. It serves as a reliable and persistent repository for various types of information.\\n\\nDatabases are widely used in computer systems and applications to store and manage data in a structured manner. They are utilized in a range of domains, including business, finance, healthcare, research, and many others.\\n\\nA database typically consists of one or more tables, which are composed of rows and columns. Each row in a table represents a record or an entity, while each column corresponds to a specific attribute or field of that record. The combination of rows and columns allows for organizing and representing complex relationships and structures within the data.\\n\\nThe structured nature of databases enables efficient querying and retrieval of information using specialized query languages such as SQL (Structured Query Language). With a well-designed database, it becomes easier to store, search, sort, update, and analyze data, providing a foundation for various operations and functionalities in software applications.\\n\\nDatabases can be classified into different types, including relational databases (such as MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL), NoSQL databases (such as MongoDB and Cassandra), and graph databases (such as Neo4j). Each type has its own strengths and is suitable for different use cases based on factors like data structure, scalability, performance requirements, and specific application needs.\\n\\nOverall, databases play a crucial role in managing and organizing large volumes of data efficiently, providing the backbone for data-driven applications and decision-making processes in numerous fields.',\n",

I can use google pay and fitbit pay in these watches, but Samsung pay is not available in Germany for wearables, so most of the time I have Fossil on my wrist. the silicone band of Gen 5 and fitbit versa 2 are also very comfortable and you can sleep with your watch. I can talk about pros and cons of these three watches for hours because I am using them for a couple of months BUT I can not say samsung is better than the other two!

I shall explain the reason for this performance improvement during the video.\\n\\nJoin My SQL Course here:\\nhttps://techtfq.com/my-sql-course\\n\\nTimestamp:\\n00:00 Introduction to Materialized View\\n02:14 What is Materialized View?\\n02:30 What does Materialized View store?\\n03:08 Creating a table with 20 million records\\n06:53 Create a Materialized View\\n08:34 How does Materialized View execute SQL queries faster?\\n09:31 Refresh Materialized View\\n12:12 What is the use of Materialized View?\\n14:08 Difference between Materialized View and View\\n\\nPlease do Subscribe to the channel and give me a Thumps up, if you found the video useful.\\n\\n🔴 WATCH MORE VIDEOS HERE 👇\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Basic concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9HQQ_COgGb7kf_1H8UWUBxO\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Intermediate concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FD9XspliRM_HZM_jK7tkii\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Advance concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9GbmgiW4TWVnxhjMFOIf0Q7\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Basic SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9F66P3GFo5O6nJ4DfZNhVsp\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Intermediate SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9EIYmNXJ8ZtQ1bmLIpt0SpV\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Complex SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9Fahr7taauUx5RnTfuGyL--\\n\\n✅ Data Analytics Career guidance:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FDsr995DjwCy9XNaIukb8P\\n\\n✅ SQL Course, SQL Training Platform Recommendations:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9GqF1Q_zn8KnYvFgtEOh-2n\\n\\n✅ Python Tutorial:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FePZXIo4jpsupqp3X0w2SW\\n\\nTHANK YOU,\\nThoufiq', 'tags': ['SQL', 'Materialized View in SQL', 'Materialized View in PostgreSQL', 'Materialized View', 'SQL Tutorial', 'Learn SQL', 'difference between view and materialized view', 'view vs materialized view', 'materialized views', 'materialized view', 'difference between views and materialized views', 'materialised views', 'indexed views', 'indexed view'], 'publishedAt': '2022-07-07T13:04:22Z', 'viewCount': '55818', 'likeCount': '1541', 'favouriteCount': None, 'commentCount': '167', 'duration': 'PT16M40S', 'definition': 'hd', 'caption': 'false'}, {'video_id': 'weCZ1WynbMI', 'channelTitle': 'techTFQ', 'title': 'Learn SQL the right way | SQL Live Training | Learn SQL from me', 'description': 'If you want to learn SQL then this video is for you.

We cover everything you need to know about SQL VIEWS and how to effectively use SQL Views.\\n\\nThe video starts by explaining what a View is and how different it is from a table. We then look at how to create a View and also explain in detail the purpose of using a view in sql. We talk about the advantages of views in sql and why we use views in SQL.\\n\\nWe then see how to create a view using CREATE OR REPLACE command and how different it is from just the CREATE VIEW command. I mention in detail all the rules you need to know when using CREATE OR REPLACE command.\\nWe also see how to modify a View using the ALTER command. \\nI also mention some tips and tricks about Views that can be essential to clear interview questions related to Views.\\n\\nAt the end of the video we look at updatable views i.e. the views which can be updated or inserted or deleted. We look at the different rules we need to follow in order to create a view which can be updated.\\n\\nFinally we talk about the WITH CHECK OPTION clause when creating a view. We understand why we use WITH CHECK OPTION clause and how is it useful in certain cases.\\n\\nThe only VIEW concept not covered in this video is about the Materialized View. I will be making a separate video about Materialized View very soon.\\n\\nHopefully this video should give you complete understanding about VIEWS and how to effectively use VIEWS in SQL.\\n\\nIf you liked this video and would like to learn more about SQL then make sure to Subscribe to my channel.\\n\\nPractice SQL Queries here: https://stratascratch.com/?via=techTFQ\\n\\nMy recommended SQL Course: https://learnsql.com/?ref=thoufiqmohammed\\n\\n[All the scripts and SQL queries used in this video is shared in my Discord server.]\\nJoin my Discord Server: https://discord.gg/8aRSbygbdu\\n\\n\\nFTC disclaimer: This video was sponsored by Skillshare. \\n\\n\\n🔴 WATCH MORE VIDEOS HERE 👇\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Basic concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9HQQ_COgGb7kf_1H8UWUBxO\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Intermediate concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FD9XspliRM_HZM_jK7tkii\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Advance concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9GbmgiW4TWVnxhjMFOIf0Q7\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Basic SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9F66P3GFo5O6nJ4DfZNhVsp\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Intermediate SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9EIYmNXJ8ZtQ1bmLIpt0SpV\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Complex SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9Fahr7taauUx5RnTfuGyL--\\n\\n✅ Data Analytics Career guidance:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FDsr995DjwCy9XNaIukb8P\\n\\n✅ SQL Course, SQL Training Platform Recommendations:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9GqF1Q_zn8KnYvFgtEOh-2n\\n\\n✅ Python Tutorial:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FePZXIo4jpsupqp3X0w2SW\\n\\nTHANK YOU,\\nThoufiq', 'tags': ['sql views', 'views in sql', 'sql views tutorial', 'sql', 'views', 'view', 'sql view', 'view in sql', 'sql view tutorial', 'sql tutorial', 'learn sql', 'create view', 'create or replace view', 'modify view', 'update view', 'insert into view', 'with check option', 'with check option in view', 'techtfq', 'techtfq sql', 'sql techtfq'], 'publishedAt': '2022-02-15T13:00:16Z', 'viewCount': '160997', 'likeCount': '3579', 'favouriteCount': None, 'commentCount': '325', 'duration': 'PT43M20S', 'definition': 'hd', 'caption': 'false'}, {'video_id': 'l6XhSFAyvO0', 'channelTitle': 'techTFQ', 'title': 'Practice Writing SQL Queries on StrataScratch | How to Solve SQL Queries', 'description': \"Visit https://stratascratch.com/?via=techTFQ and use the discount code “ss15” to get 15% off on any StrataScratch subscription.\\n\\nIn this video, I will be solving some SQL Interview queries on StrataScratch. StrataScratch is an online platform where you can find hundreds of interview questions related to SQL and Python. You can solve these SQL Interview Questions on the StrataScratch platform itself without the need to install any database or any other software. \\n\\nThere are hundreds of different SQL Interview problem which have been asked by big tech companies. You would find SQL questions for beginner, for intermediate level and for expert level programmers. So no matter what your level of expertise is in SQL, you would find several different SQL questions to solve depending on your skill level.\\n\\nIn this video, I will solve 2 different SQL questions, \\nFirst we shall solve the “Users By Avg Session time” question. Now I will be providing 2 different solutions to this problem. One solution using subqueries and the second solution using JOINS. Hopefully this gives you an idea of how to solve a problem using different approaches.\\nSecondly, we shall solve the “Seat Availability” question. We shall solve this problem using self JOIN and UNION operator. \\n\\nI will explain in detail my thinking behind solving these problems and also the reasoning behind using certain logic.\\n\\nMy recommended SQL Course: https://learnsql.com/?ref=thoufiqmoha...\\n\\n[All the scripts and SQL queries used in this video is shared in my Discord server.

In the first part of this video series, I had covered INNER Join, LEFT join and RIGHT Join.\\n\\nI start this video by discussing about FULL OUTER Join. But in order to understand FULL OUTER Join, we need to first look at the difference in output from INNER, LEFT and RIGHT JOIN. So we go through the difference in these 3 joins first and then I explain the concept of FULL OUTER Join.\\nWe then cover CROSS join and I explain a scenario where you may need to use CROSS join.\\nWe then talk about NATURAL join. I\\'ll tell you the difference between NATURAL join and INNER join and also tell you why you should not be using NATURAL Join.\\nFinally, we cover one of the most important JOINS in SQL which is the SELF JOIN. I explain SELF join by taking a real world example. \\nEvery concept is explained by writing SQL queries so hopefully this video along with the first part of this video, should help you to completely understand JOINS in SQL.\\n\\nJoins are the most fundamental concepts in SQL and having a clear understanding of Joins is very essential to write good SQL queries.\\n\\nTimeline:\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:54 FULL OUTER JOIN in SQL\\n10:20 CROSS JOIN in SQL\\n16:44 NATURAL JOIN in SQL\\n21:51 SELF JOIN in SQL\\n\\nWatch the first part of this SQL JOINS Tutorial Series:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OQJDd3QqQM&t=1720s \\n\\nMy recommended SQL Course: https://learnsql.com/?ref=thoufiqmohammed\\n\\nJoin my Discord Server: https://discord.gg/8aRSbygbdu\\n\\nJoin my FREE live SQL training session:\\nBatch 1 - Started on 03-Jan-2022 (08:00 pm Malaysian Time / 05:30 pm Indian Time)\\nDay: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday\\nRegistration Link: https://www.lighthall.co/class/305d73cb-2381-4499-9088-54e82a4de7b8/\\n\\nBatch 2 - Starts on 17-Jan-2022 (09:30 pm Malaysian Time / 07:00 pm Indian Time)\\nDay: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday\\nRegistration Link: https://www.lighthall.co/class/185a13de-31a5-475a-abc3-b64926c054dc/\\n\\nNote: Both batch 1 and batch 2 will cover the exact same topics.

Finally, we build simple visualization from this data using the Python Seaborn library.\\n\\nLink to create YouTube API Key: https://console.cloud.google.com/\\nLink to Google YouTube Data API documentation: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3\\nLink to my blog where you can download this project for free: https://techtfq.com/video/python-project-to-scrape-youtube-using-youtube-data-api\\n\\nTimestamp:\\n00:00 Intro\\n01:19 How to generate YouTube API Key\\n03:27 Google YouTube Data API Documentation\\n07:48 Pre Requisite for project (Creating virtual environment and install python packages)\\n09:45 Part 1 - Scrape Channel statistics from youtube. Analyze and Visualize YouTube channel\\n32:32 Part 2 - Scrape Video details for a youtube channel. Analyze and Visualize video details.\\n\\nWe start this project by first creating an YouTube API Key which will be our credential to access youtube data. I will should you in detail, how to create an API Key. \\nOnce the API Key is generated, we will then learn how to use this API key to access different youtube data. I.e. we will walk through the documentation given by google to use youtube API. We will look at the different sections in the documentation to access different data we need to build this project. We will also look at the sample python code given by google to call different resources and methods to fetch youtube data.\\n\\nFinally, we will get into writing the python code to build this project. I will be using Jupyter Notebook to write my python code. Since it is a new project, we will create a new virtual environment for this project. We will use anaconda for this. Once the virtual environment is set, we will then install all the required python packages. So we will install \"google-api-python-client\" (which is the google python package required to access youtube api data), we will also install pandas and seaborn. I will show you how to create a virtual environment and also how to install all these packages in detail.\\n\\nOnce our environment is set and required packages are installed, we will then start writing the code in Jupyter Notebook. I have divided this project into 2 parts.\\nIn the first part, we extract channel details from youtube. I.e. we extract details such as youtube channel name, total no of subscribers, total views and total number of videos posted by each channel. We gather these details for few Data Analyst/Data Scientist kind of channel and then compare these channel data with each other. We shall see who has the highest subscriber and who gets the most views and the amount of videos posted by these channels. We will be loading all of this data into a pandas dataframe and then analyze it. We will also generate some basic visualization using this data so we can easily compare these multiple channels.\\n\\nIn the second part of the video, we shall build a logic to extract video details from a particular channel. We shall extract details such as video title, total views each video has got, total number of likes, dislikes and comments each video has got. We shall extract these details for all of the videos posted by a particular channel. We will then analyze this data by loading it into a pandas dataframe.

We shall see what is ANACONDA, how to use ANACONDA for python and why do we need to use ANACONDA for python. We shall also cover how to install anaconda on Mac OS. The installation would be similar for Windows and Linux systems as well.\\n\\nIf you are new to python, then you would probably have heard of anaconda but for a beginner it would be very confusing to know why do we need anaconda and how to use it and how is it beneficial to use anaconda over standalone python. So that is why in this video, I want to make it very clear on what is anaconda and why you should be using it.\\n\\nTimestamp\\n00:00 Intro\\n00:39 What is Anaconda for python and Why do we need to use Anaconda?\\n03:30 How to install anaconda? Getting started with Anaconda\\n08:17 How to use Visual Studio code IDE with anaconda\\n10:05 How to create virtual environment using anaconda\\n12:05 How to work with different anaconda virtual environments\\n15:23 What are anaconda channels and how to add channels to anaconda\\n\\nAnaconda is a python distribution, meaning when you install anaconda, it comes with python, a lot of python packages, tools and software which would be very essential especially if you are working in the field of data science. Anaconda also comes with conda, which is a package manager similar to pip. Conda can be used to install python packages and conda can also be used to create and manage virtual environments.\\nSo anaconda can be treated as a bundle package which not only includes python but everything else you would need to conveniently work with python especially in the field of data science.\\nSo we start this video by talking about what is anaconda and why we should be using it. I also mention a use case where using anaconda can be very beneficial.\\n\\nOnce we understand what is anaconda and why we should be using it, we then move into installing anaconda in our machine. Since I use Mac OS, the video shows how to install anaconda on Mac OS but the process would be same if you are on Windows or Linux system as well.\\n\\nOnce anaconda is installed, we then see how to use conda base environment. We see how to use anaconda with Visual Studio Code IDE which is also referred to as VS Code. We look at the different conda commands.\\nWe then see how to create different virtual environments using conda command and then create specific python packages in each of our virtual environments. We then see how to work with different anaconda virtual environments in VS code.\\n\\nFinally, we talk about channels in anaconda. We see what is a channel and how to add a new channel to the existing list of channels in anaconda. \\n\\nCHEAT CODE of all the ANACONDA commands used in this video:\\nconda (List down all conda commands)\\nconda list (List of all the python packages in the activated environment)\\nconda env list (List of all environments)\\nconda activate env-name (Activate environment \"env-name\")\\nconda deactivate (Deactivate from current conda environment)\\nconda create —name env-name python=3.7 (Create a virtual environment)\\nconda env remove —name DS-env (Remove a virtual environment)\\nconda install scikit-learn (Install a python package by name \"scikit-learn\")\\npython3 —version (Get python version in current environment)\\nwhich python3 (Get the location where python is installed)\\nconda config —show channels (List of all channels in anaconda)\\nconda config —get channels (List of all channels along with its priority)\\nconda config —add channels conda-forge (Add a new channel)\\nconda config —remove channels conda-forge (Remove a channel)\\n\\n🔴 WATCH MORE VIDEOS HERE 👇\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Basic concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9HQQ_COgGb7kf_1H8UWUBxO\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Intermediate concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FD9XspliRM_HZM_jK7tkii\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Advance concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9GbmgiW4TWVnxhjMFOIf0Q7\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Basic SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9F66P3GFo5O6nJ4DfZNhVsp\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Intermediate SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9EIYmNXJ8ZtQ1bmLIpt0SpV\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Complex SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9Fahr7taauUx5RnTfuGyL--\\n\\n✅ Data Analytics Career guidance:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FDsr995DjwCy9XNaIukb8P\\n\\n✅ SQL Course, SQL Training Platform Recommendations:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9GqF1Q_zn8KnYvFgtEOh-2n\\n\\n✅ Python Tutorial:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FePZXIo4jpsupqp3X0w2SW\\n\\n✅ Git and GitHub Tutorial:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9EI1MPlqqDpe3bgr8RJZE0b\\n\\n✅ Data Analytics Projects:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9HwT_uStsDdJbuBOt_XD0ch\\n\\nTHANK YOU,\\nThoufiq', 'tags': ['Anaconda Tutorial for Python', 'How to Install Anaconda and How to use Anaconda for Python', 'How to install Anaconda for Python', 'How to use Anaconda for Python', 'Why do we need Anaconda', 'anaconda for python', 'python anaconda', 'anaconda python tutorial', 'python anaconda tutorial', 'anaconda tutorial', 'install anaconda', 'install anaconda mac', 'How to Install Anaconda on Mac OS', 'how to install anaconda on mac', 'how to install anaconda', 'anaconda installation', 'python tutorial'], 'publishedAt': '2021-09-21T13:00:00Z', 'viewCount': '75395', 'likeCount': '1265', 'favouriteCount': None, 'commentCount': '80', 'duration': 'PT19M57S', 'definition': 'hd', 'caption': 'false'}, {'video_id': 'M2NzvnfS-hI', 'channelTitle': 'techTFQ', 'title': 'Connect to PostgreSQL from Python (Using SQL in Python) | Python to PostgreSQL', 'description': 'Connect to PostgreSQL from Python (Using SQL in Python) | Python to PostgreSQL\\nIn this video, we shall understand how to connect to PostgreSQL Database from Python. We shall write a python program which will use the Psycopg2 module to connect to the PostgreSQL database and then perform some database or SQL transactions such as creating a table and then insert data to the table, updating a table data and delete records from the table using python code. We shall also see how to fetch table data from postgres database to python program.\\n\\nAt the end of the video, I will also cover how to use Context Manager to perform all of the above SQL operations. That is, we will use the WITH clause to connect to the database and also use the WITH clause to open the cursor.

Using context manager is simply using the WITH clause while connecting to the database and then also using the WITH clause while opening the cursor.\\nI will also mention the advantages of using a context manager over the traditional method or connecting to data and opening the cursor. And also mention why is it recommended to always use context manager when connecting to database in python.\\n\\nHopefully this video helped and gave you some useful information of using SQL within python program.

You may be familiar with the concept such as window function but until and unless you apply these concepts to write SQL queries, you will never truly understand SQL.\\n\\nMay of the queries I am going to solve in this video, I will be using window function such as LEAD, LAG, RANK, ROW_NUMBER etc. However, some of the queries are solved using self join, sub queries or inner joins.\\n\\nThe idea behind making this video, is to explain the thinking behind solving an SQL question. How to read the question and understand the problem statement and then analyze the existing data so that we can come up with an approach to write a query which can return the required result. These steps are very important in order for us to determine the different SQL concepts or functions to be used to solve the problem.\\n\\nPlease comment below your feedback if you liked this kind of video or if you have any doubts on any other queries mentioned in the blog.\\n\\n🔴 WATCH MORE VIDEOS HERE 👇\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Basic concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9HQQ_COgGb7kf_1H8UWUBxO\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Intermediate concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FD9XspliRM_HZM_jK7tkii\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Advance concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9GbmgiW4TWVnxhjMFOIf0Q7\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Basic SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9F66P3GFo5O6nJ4DfZNhVsp\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Intermediate SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9EIYmNXJ8ZtQ1bmLIpt0SpV\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Complex SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9Fahr7taauUx5RnTfuGyL--\\n\\n✅ Data Analytics Career guidance:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FDsr995DjwCy9XNaIukb8P\\n\\n✅ SQL Course, SQL Training Platform Recommendations:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9GqF1Q_zn8KnYvFgtEOh-2n\\n\\n✅ Python Tutorial:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FePZXIo4jpsupqp3X0w2SW\\n\\n✅ Git and GitHub Tutorial:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9EI1MPlqqDpe3bgr8RJZE0b\\n\\n✅ Data Analytics Projects:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9HwT_uStsDdJbuBOt_XD0ch\\n\\nTHANK YOU,\\nThoufiq', 'tags': ['how to write complex sql queries', 'learn how to write sql queries', 'practice complex sql queries', 'Learn how to write SQL Queries(Practice Complex SQL Queries)', 'Learn how to write SQL Queries (Practice Complex SQL Queries)', 'sql queries', 'practice sql queries', 'how to write sql queries', 'sql query', 'sql queries using window function', 'window function sql queries', 'sql query using self join', 'complex sql queries', 'sql', 'query', 'writing sql query', 'practice sql', 'learn sql', 'sql tutorial'], 'publishedAt': '2021-08-22T12:54:58Z', 'viewCount': '1198102', 'likeCount': '27579', 'favouriteCount': None, 'commentCount': '1013', 'duration': 'PT49M56S', 'definition': 'hd', 'caption': 'false'}, {'video_id': 'zAmJPdZu8Rg', 'channelTitle': 'techTFQ', 'title': 'SQL Window Function | How to write SQL Query using Frame Clause, CUME_DIST | SQL Queries Tutorial', 'description': 'SQL Window Function.

SQL Window Functions covered in this video are FIRST_VALUE, LAST_VALUE, NTH_VALUE, NTILE, CUME_DIST and PERCENT_RANK. Also we cover how to use FRAME Clause while writing SQL Queries using window function. We also look at alternate way of writing SQL Query using window function. \\n\\nWe discuss in detail about the Frame clause and how RANGE is different from ROWS and how to use Unbounded Preceding and Unbounded Following while using certain window functions.\\n\\nThis is the second video where we talk about window functions in SQL.

Link to the previous video is mentioned below:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww71knvhQ-s&t=119s\\n\\nThis video is focused on teaching how to write SQL Queries using different window functions or analytic functions. We go through the syntax of using first value, last value, frame clause, nth value. ntile, cume dist and percent rank as window function in SQL query.\\n\\nWe look at how to use WINDOW clause while writing SQL query using window functions. We talk about the OVER clause and how partition by clause can impact the result set.\\n\\nOver clause is explained in detail in this video.

Git is a version control system which can be used to track any changes in a repository. \\nWe shall first understand what is Git and why do we need to use it. We shall then see how to install Git and configure Git. We will also look at the Git Workflow.\\nIn this video, I am going to build a simple digital clock using python. But I will build this project step by step so you can see how I add and commit different changes to git repository. \\n\\nTimeline:\\n00:00 Intro\\n01:10 What is Git\\n04:07 How to Install Git\\n05:52 How to Configure Git\\n07:39 How to create a Git Repository\\n10:07 What is Git Branch\\n11:41 Understanding Git Workflow\\n12:41 Git add (Adding changes to Git Staging area)\\n15:10 Git commit (Commit change to Git Repository)\\n18:29 Git log (Viewing the commit history)\\n23:16 Creating a Git Branch\\n26:52 Merge Branch\\n29:54 How to use Git Reset\\n31:08 How to use Git Checkout\\n32:21 Git Detached HEAD state\\n35:09 Finally comparing changes in multiple git branch \\n\\nWe shall also see the three layers of git repository i.e. the working directory, staging area and git repository.\\n\\nI am going explain in detail how to add files to staging area and then remove files form staging area if required. We shall see how to commit changes. We shall also discuss about the significance of git staging area and why we need it.\\n\\nFinally, we shall see what is a branch and how to create a branch and how to switch between different git branches. I will explain the significance of having multiple branch in your git repository and how we can merge changes from one branch to another.\\n\\nMerging branch is an important feature of Git so we shall explain git merge by creating a real digital clock project.\\n\\nThis video also covers git reset and git checkout. We use git reset and checkout to point HEAD to a different commit or different version of the repository. We shall see the difference between reset and checkout commands.\\n\\nHopefully this video should give you a complete idea about git and how to start working with git.\\n\\n\\n🔴 WATCH MORE VIDEOS HERE 👇\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Basic concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9HQQ_COgGb7kf_1H8UWUBxO\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Intermediate concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FD9XspliRM_HZM_jK7tkii\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Advance concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9GbmgiW4TWVnxhjMFOIf0Q7\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Basic SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9F66P3GFo5O6nJ4DfZNhVsp\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Intermediate SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9EIYmNXJ8ZtQ1bmLIpt0SpV\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Complex SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9Fahr7taauUx5RnTfuGyL--\\n\\n✅ Data Analytics Career guidance:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FDsr995DjwCy9XNaIukb8P\\n\\n✅ SQL Course, SQL Training Platform Recommendations:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9GqF1Q_zn8KnYvFgtEOh-2n\\n\\n✅ Python Tutorial:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FePZXIo4jpsupqp3X0w2SW\\n\\n✅ Git and GitHub Tutorial:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9EI1MPlqqDpe3bgr8RJZE0b\\n\\n✅ Data Analytics Projects:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9HwT_uStsDdJbuBOt_XD0ch\\n\\nTHANK YOU,\\nThoufiq', 'tags': ['git', 'learn git', 'git tutorial', 'git tutorial for beginners', 'git tutorial for complete beginners', 'learn git in 35 mins', 'learn git in 35 minutes', 'learn git in 30 mins', 'learn git in 30 minutes', 'what is git', 'how to install git', 'git repository', 'configure git', 'git workflow', 'git branch', 'git checkout', 'git merge', 'git switch', 'git add', 'git commit', 'GIT', 'Git', 'git for beginners', 'git basics', 'how to use git', 'git training', 'git course', 'learn git fast'], 'publishedAt': '2021-07-16T12:00:32Z', 'viewCount': '39494', 'likeCount': '1428', 'favouriteCount': None, 'commentCount': '133', 'duration': 'PT36M39S', 'definition': 'hd', 'caption': 'false'}, {'video_id': 'LCVSmkyB4v8', 'channelTitle': 'techTFQ', 'title': 'Web Scraping in Python using Beautiful Soup | Writing a Python program to Scrape IMDB website', 'description': 'Web Scraping in Python using Beautiful Soup module. In this video I will explain how to perform web scraping in Python using Beautiful Soup and Requests module. I will write a python program to scrape the IMDB website and then load the desired data into an excel file. I will write this program from scratch so you can follow along.\\n\\nWeb Scraping is the process of programmatically extracting some data from a website. In Python, we can easy write program to scrape website by using the Beautiful Soup and Requests module. Requests module can be used to access the desired website and Beautiful Soup module can be used to parse the HTML source code of the website. Beautiful soup makes it very easy to parse HTML content and then provides multiple methods which can be used to extract the data from any HTML tags. All the website are written in HTML language hence in order to perform web scrapping, our program needs to read the HTML content. This is were Beautiful Soup comes into picture to make it very easy to access the contents of HTML using very simple methods.\\n\\nYou don’t need to be an expert in HTML to learn python web scrapping. You just need to know the most basic HTML which is to know what is a tag and how to identify the attributes associated with a tag. \\n\\nIn this video, in order to explain the concept of web scraping using BeautifulSoup in Python, we will be writing a python program which will access the IMDB website and then fetch the top rated movies present in the IMDB website and then load this data into an excel file.\\nIMDB website contains movie ratings but in this program we are only interested in scraping the top rated movies of all time only.\\n\\nIn order to load data into an excel file, I will be using openpyxl module. Using openpyxl, it is very easy to create a new excel file and then rename the sheet name and then load data into the excel file. I won’t be explaining openpyxl in detail but will just cover enough to know how to create an excel file and then load data into an excel file.\\n\\nWe will be installing Requests module and Beautiful Soup module using the pip installer. I am using mac so the command in mac to be run from terminal is “pip3 install module_name”. If you are using windows then you need to run the pip install command from command prompt using the command as “pip install module_name”.\\n\\n🔴 WATCH MORE VIDEOS HERE 👇\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Basic concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9HQQ_COgGb7kf_1H8UWUBxO\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Intermediate concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FD9XspliRM_HZM_jK7tkii\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Advance concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9GbmgiW4TWVnxhjMFOIf0Q7\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Basic SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9F66P3GFo5O6nJ4DfZNhVsp\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Intermediate SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9EIYmNXJ8ZtQ1bmLIpt0SpV\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Complex SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9Fahr7taauUx5RnTfuGyL--\\n\\n✅ Data Analytics Career guidance:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FDsr995DjwCy9XNaIukb8P\\n\\n✅ SQL Course, SQL Training Platform Recommendations:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9GqF1Q_zn8KnYvFgtEOh-2n\\n\\n✅ Python Tutorial:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FePZXIo4jpsupqp3X0w2SW\\n\\n✅ Git and GitHub Tutorial:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9EI1MPlqqDpe3bgr8RJZE0b\\n\\n✅ Data Analytics Projects:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9HwT_uStsDdJbuBOt_XD0ch\\n\\nTHANK YOU,\\nThoufiq', 'tags': ['python', 'python tutorial', 'web scraping', 'python web scraping', 'python web scraping tutorial', 'scrape website in python', 'beautiful soup', 'beautifulsoup', 'beautifulsoup4', 'bs4', 'requests', 'python web scraping using beautiful soup', 'web scraping in python using beautiful soup', 'scrape imdb website', 'scrape imdb', 'openpyxl', 'python programming', 'web scraping tutorial', 'python for beginners', 'web crawling', 'python requests', 'web scraping using python', 'web scraping using python beautifulsoup', 'techtfq'], 'publishedAt': '2021-07-05T12:00:04Z', 'viewCount': '118466', 'likeCount': '4028', 'favouriteCount': None, 'commentCount': '350', 'duration': 'PT37M30S', 'definition': 'hd', 'caption': 'false'}, {'video_id': '6x7vHXfRAP0', 'channelTitle': 'techTFQ', 'title': 'Thank you for 1000 subscribers | Channel update | Who am i? & What i do?', 'description': \"This video is to thank my YouTube community for all the support and love during the first year of this channel.

In this video, we look at how to Practice SQL queries and python programming using LeetCode.  \\nIf you are new to programming or if you are learning a new programming language, then one of the challenges you may be facing is “How to practice what you learn?”.\\nIn this video, we look at LeetCode which is a platform used to solve programming problems using any programming languages like Java, Python, JavaScript, Ruby, PhP, etc. There are also problems which can be solved in SQL and we can use any RDBMS to solve it such as Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL etc.\\n\\nThe best way to practice programming is by working on projects but then if you are a beginner then identifying what projects to work on and how to get started working on a project can be a daunting task. An alternative approach is to practice programming using platforms such as LeetCode. \\n\\nLeetCode is a website where you can find hundreds of programming problems which can be solved using any programming language of your choice. The problems are very good and can be the problems asked in a programming interview.

This video covers all the basic concepts required to get started with file handling in Python. File objects in Python can be used to read the contents of a file and also file objects can be used to write or append data into a file. \\n\\nIn this video, we cover all the basic concepts required to get started with handing files in Python. We first look at how to read a file which is stored in our operating system. And then cover the concepts of how to write data into a file and also how to append data into a file. \\nWe check out the different between using write and append in Python.\\n\\nTo open the file, we use context manager as well as the traditional method to open a file. We talk about the advantages of using context manager while opening a file in python and also explain why it is recommended in python to always use context manager when dealing with files.\\n\\nTimestamps:\\n00:00 How to Read and Write Files in Python\\n00:39 How to Read a file in Python\\n02:55 How to use Context Manager to open a file in Python\\n07:16 How to Write a file in Python\\n09:09 How to Append a file in Python\\n10:20 Program to read a file and append data to another file\\n13:17 How to access files in different path in Python\\n\\nIn this video, we also talk about to how to read a file which is present in different paths or directories. By providing absolute path or relative path to the file we can tell python to look for the desired file in that specific location. However, we can also change the current working directory to point at the path where our desired file is placed.\\nIf path is not mentioned, then Python always looks for the file in the current working directory. However, we can change the current working directory so as to point it to the location where our desired file is placed.\\nAlternatively, we can also provide the directory path of the file which we are trying to read. We can specify a path in two ways, one is by specifying the absolute path and second is by specifying the relative path.\\nIn this video, we talk about relative and absolute path and also show how you can extract the current working directory and also how you can change the current working directory.\\n\\nHope you learnt something from this video.

Regular Expressions Python Tutorial.\\nThis video is a complete tutorial on Regular Expressions in Python. This is a full course on how to use Regular Expressions in python. Regular Expression is also referred to as REGEX. Using Regular Expression, we can search for a pattern of string in the given text.\\n\\nRegular Expressions are a very powerful tool used to perform complex searches on a text. By specifying a pattern for the string, we need to search for, Regular Expressions can extract a string even if it is present in different format until and unless this string follows the same pattern as mentioned in the defined Regular Expressions pattern.\\n\\nIn this video, we go through the different steps to be followed to use Regular Expressions in python. We also explain the different character class, special characters and also all the Regular Expressions symbols or notations which can be used to define or create a pattern in Regular Expressions in python. We also write multiple python programs to create different patterns to match an email id, phone no and date values. Finally, we also cover the sub method in Regular Expression which can replace or substitute the matched string with a replacement string.\\n \\nThere are only 4 steps to be followed in order to use Regular Expressions in python:\\n    1. Import re module which is the Regular Expressions module in python. All the functions and features required to perform regular expression search in python can be accessed by importing the re module.\\n    2. Next steps is to create the Regular Expressions Pattern. Pattern is basically the format or structure of the string that we are trying to search. In Regular Expressions, we have several different character classes, symbols and special characters which will help us to identify every kind of characters or symbols hence making it possible to define a pattern to search of any type of string.\\n    3. Once the pattern is defined, next step is to search for this pattern in the given text or data.\\n    4. Finally, we extract all the matched string.\\n\\nI hope this video was helpful and gives you a good understanding of regular expressions in python.

We explain in the simplest of terms what does data science mean? \\n\\nThere are several definitions for data science on the internet but in this video, we look at the core of data science and try to understand the most basic reason why data science is so widely used. Data Science can be a tricky topic if you are new to the world of data, so we explain data science for beginners in this video.\\n\\nWe look at the different problems data science can solve and how data science helps to solve these problems. Rather than giving in depth knowledge of data science, we give an overview of what data science is and who uses data science and why is data science used and what makes data science such a popular field of choice today. We go through few use cases of data science and how we can use data science methods to solve various types of problems. \\n\\nUnderstanding data science without being aware of its life cycle would be an incomplete understanding hence we go through the different stages involved in the life cycle of a data science project. Under each stage of data science life cycle, we explain why it is used and how does it help to solve the problem.\\n\\nLife Cycle of a Data Science project generally involves the below 6 stages:\\n1) Understanding the Requirement / Problem\\n2) Data Extraction and Data Cleansing\\n3) Exploratory Data Analysis\\n4) Data Visualization\\n5) Predictive Analytics\\n6) Prescriptive Analytics\\n\\nWe also mention the tools used during different stages of a Data Science project such as Python, SQL, Machine Learning Models, Hadoop, Spark, Spreadsheets etc.\\nWe also talk about the role played by a Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Business Analyst, Data Engineer and Software Engineers during different stages of the data science project.\\n\\nI hope this video was helpful and gives you an overview of Data Science.

Handling exceptions is one of the most important aspects of a good python program hence in python we can handle exceptions by placing the block of code which we assume to be causing error inside a try and except block. \\nAny error caused by the block of code within the try except clause won’t be returned to the user but will be handled by the except block. \\n\\nIn Python, we can also raise user defined exceptions using the raise Exception clause. Raise exception can be used anywhere in the code to cause an error based on certain conditions. \\nWe can raise and exception within the try except block so the user defined error can be caught by the try except block. \\n\\nWithin try except exception handling in python, we can also use ELSE and FINALLY clause. Block of code within else will be executed when the code within try does not throw an error. If the block of code within try causes an exception, then the except block will be called and the block of code within except will be executed. \\nBlock of code within finally, will be executed every time.

How to write a function in python program and different functionalities associated with python functions are covered in this video.\\n\\nWe start by explaining the definition of function and show a sample python code to create a function. How to create a function with a parameter and without a parameter is shown with sample python program. We look at what a parameter is and how to pass an argument during function call. We discuss the difference between an argument and a parameter in python functions.\\n\\nWe also cover return statements in python function. We see what happens when we write a function without a return statement. We also cover how to pass a return value in function. \\n\\nFinally, we go through each of these concepts in python functions by writing a sample python program to count the number of vowel characters in a given name. In this sample program we create a function named count vowels using the DEF keyword and then pass a parameter to it. From the python program we call this count vowels function and pass an argument which will be used by our function to find the number of vowel characters in it.\\n\\nThis video is aimed at beginners who would like to understand what a function is in python and how to create a function in python and how to use a parameter and use a return statement in python functions. \\n\\nThe purpose of this Python tutorial series for beginners is to explain python programming in the most simplest manner by providing simple examples and working out interesting and meaningful python programs which should be a better way to learn programming especially for the beginners. \\n\\nAll the programs and content of this video will be posted in my website https://techtfq.com/ \\n\\nSo please make sure to check that out as well.\\n\\nOther video’s in this tutorial series:\\n\\nImport modules in Python | Import module from different directory | Python Tutorial for Beginners #5\\nhttps://youtu.be/HNChkuE6HyA\\n\\nWHILE loop and FOR loop in Python | LOOP statements in Python | Python Tutorial for Beginners #4\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gFqUWO-AWM&t=107s\\n\\nIF ELSE ELIF statement in Python | IF ELSE Statement in Python | Python Tutorial for Beginners #3\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvdSKgQcyuc&t=28s\\n\\nWhat is a VARIABLE in Python | Python Variables | Python Tutorial for Beginners #2\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBb_duZIusU&t=21s\\n\\nWhat are DATA TYPE, OPERATORS and EXPRESSION in Python | Python Tutorial for Absolute Beginners #1\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRGkYivK2xI&t=68s\\n\\nPlease like, subscribe and leave a comment if you found the video to be useful.

But before writing IF statement, we learn what is a Boolean data type, what are comparison operators and what are boolean operators or Logical operators. These concepts are required to be understood before starting with IF ELSE statement.\\n\\n\\nIF statement is part of the Flow Control statements in python which also includes loop statements such as while loop and for loop. \\nFlow control statement or control flow statement in python decides which instruction to execute based on which condition hence it’s a very essential part of python programming.\\n\\nThe condition in IF statement either needs to have an expression which always evaluate to a boolean value or the condition in IF statement needs to have a boolean value. \\nUnderstanding of Python Boolean is essential to understand IF statement. We also cover boolean operator which is also referred to as logical operator. Finally we also look into comparison operator which is required to form an expression which can be used in IF statement.\\n\\nIF statement in python also includes ELIF (which stands for ELSE IF) and ELSE section which is explained in the video by writing sample program which uses these IF, ELSE and ELIF statements to perform certain actions.\\n\\nAll these concepts are not just explained theoretically but also by working out some examples using the IDLE IDE which comes along with your Python installation and also using Visual Studio code IDE to write and execute python program.\\n\\nThe purpose of this Python tutorial series for beginners is to explain python programming in the most simplest manner by providing simple examples and working out interesting and meaningful python programs which should be a better way to learn programming especially for the beginners.\\n\\nAll the programs and content of this video will be posted in my website https://techtfq.com/ \\nSo please make sure to check that out as well.\\n\\nOther video’s in this tutorial series:\\n\\nWhat are DATA TYPE, OPERATORS and EXPRESSION in Python | Python Tutorial for Absolute Beginners #1\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRGkYivK2xI&t=68s\\n\\nWhat is a VARIABLE in Python | Python Tutorial for Absolute Beginners #2\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBb_duZIusU&t=13s\\n\\nPlease like, subscribe and leave a comment if you found the video to be useful.

Using IDLE, which is an IDE that comes along with Python installation.\\n    2. Using any text editor (in my case I use Atom) to write python program and then execute the program using Terminal window.\\n    3. By using Visual Studio Code (or simple VS Code), which is considered as one of the best IDE for Python.\\n\\nInstalling Python 3 on Mac can be confusing due to the existence of Python 2 which is preinstalled on all Mac OS. However, Python 2 and Python 3 can co-exist on the same machine hence we do not need to uninstall Python 2 before installing Python 3.\\n\\nTo Install Python 3, there are no prerequisites, and the installation is pretty straight forward.\\nTo run your Python code may be confusing for beginners hence in this video we cover 3 different ways or 3 different editors which can be used to get started with writing and running python code.\\n\\nWhen executing python code through IDLE, it’s essential to execute the RUN command from the text editor and then view the output in IDLE interpreter.\\nWhereas text editor does not have the functionality to run program by itself hence we use Terminal window to run the program.\\nVisual Studio Code (or simple VS Code) along with PyCharm, Jupiter Notebook and few others are considered as one of the best IDE for Python hence in this video we show how VS Code can be used to write and Run Python program.\\n\\nThe video is aimed at helping beginners to get started with installation of Python programming language on Mac and by showing multiple ways to start writing and executing Python code. \\n\\nReference Links:\\nPython Download:\\nhttps://www.python.org/downloads/\\n\\nVisual Studio Code Download:\\nhttps://code.visualstudio.com/download\\n\\nAtom Download:\\nhttps://atom.io/\\n\\n\\nPlease like, subscribe and click on the notification bell to be notified of my latest video’s.\\n\\n🔴 WATCH MORE VIDEOS HERE 👇\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Basic concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9HQQ_COgGb7kf_1H8UWUBxO\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Intermediate concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FD9XspliRM_HZM_jK7tkii\\n\\n✅ SQL Tutorial - Advance concepts:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9GbmgiW4TWVnxhjMFOIf0Q7\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Basic SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9F66P3GFo5O6nJ4DfZNhVsp\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Intermediate SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9EIYmNXJ8ZtQ1bmLIpt0SpV\\n\\n✅ Practice Solving Complex SQL Queries:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9Fahr7taauUx5RnTfuGyL--\\n\\n✅ Data Analytics Career guidance:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FDsr995DjwCy9XNaIukb8P\\n\\n✅ SQL Course, SQL Training Platform Recommendations:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9GqF1Q_zn8KnYvFgtEOh-2n\\n\\n✅ Python Tutorial:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9FePZXIo4jpsupqp3X0w2SW\\n\\n✅ Git and GitHub Tutorial:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9EI1MPlqqDpe3bgr8RJZE0b\\n\\n✅ Data Analytics Projects:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavw5C92dz9HwT_uStsDdJbuBOt_XD0ch\\n\\nTHANK YOU,\\nThoufiq', 'tags': ['install python on mac', 'install python', 'how to install python', 'how to install python on mac', 'how to run python code', 'run python code', 'run python code on mac', 'python', 'python 3', 'python3', 'python mac', 'python mac install', 'how to run python code on mac', 'execute python code', 'execute python code on mac', 'how to execute python code', 'how to execute python code on mac', 'run python code using IDLE', 'run python code using VS Code', 'run python code using terminal', 'IDLE', 'VS Code', 'python tutorial'], 'publishedAt': '2021-01-11T00:49:40Z', 'viewCount': '446954', 'likeCount': '6011', 'favouriteCount': None, 'commentCount': '348', 'duration': 'PT9M54S', 'definition': 'hd', 'caption': 'false'}, {'video_id': 'i7BjHjRafU8', 'channelTitle': 'techTFQ', 'title': 'Excel Alternative: How to use SQL to perform EXCEL tasks (SQL for Data Analysis)', 'description': 'Microsoft Excel Alternative: How to use SQL to perform EXCEL tasks and use SQL for Data Analysis.\\nCan we use SQL to perform Excel tasks?

Not a problem for Example 1 (output integers 1 through 10), but for Example 2 it means you would have to go back in time to a time before INNER JOIN was invented (pre-1992!) and change your (INNER) JOIN to a Cartesian join (using the old-school comma-separated list of tablenames...not even the CROSS JOIN syntax!) followed by the appropriate WHERE clause to ensure you only get back the same rows that you would have with an INNER JOIN.

It serves as a reliable and persistent repository for various types of information.\\n\\nDatabases are widely used in computer systems and applications to store and manage data in a structured manner. They are utilized in a range of domains, including business, finance, healthcare, research, and many others.\\n\\nA database typically consists of one or more tables, which are composed of rows and columns. Each row in a table represents a record or an entity, while each column corresponds to a specific attribute or field of that record. The combination of rows and columns allows for organizing and representing complex relationships and structures within the data.\\n\\nThe structured nature of databases enables efficient querying and retrieval of information using specialized query languages such as SQL (Structured Query Language). With a well-designed database, it becomes easier to store, search, sort, update, and analyze data, providing a foundation for various operations and functionalities in software applications.\\n\\nDatabases can be classified into different types, including relational databases (such as MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL), NoSQL databases (such as MongoDB and Cassandra), and graph databases (such as Neo4j). Each type has its own strengths and is suitable for different use cases based on factors like data structure, scalability, performance requirements, and specific application needs.\\n\\nOverall, databases play a crucial role in managing and organizing large volumes of data efficiently, providing the backbone for data-driven applications and decision-making processes in numerous fields.', 'Great video!
